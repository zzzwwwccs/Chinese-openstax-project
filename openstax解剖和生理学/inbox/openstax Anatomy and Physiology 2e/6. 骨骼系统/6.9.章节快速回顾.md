# [[6.1.骨骼系统的功能|1. The Functions of the Skeletal System  骨骼系统的功能]]

The major functions of the bones are body support, facilitation of movement, protection of internal organs, storage of minerals and fat, and hematopoiesis. Together, the muscular system and skeletal system are known as the musculoskeletal system.  
骨骼的主要功能是支撑身体、促进运动、保护内脏、储存矿物质和脂肪以及造血。肌肉系统和骨骼系统统称为肌肉骨骼系统。

# [[6.2.骨骼分类|2. Bone Classification 骨骼分类]]

Bones can be classified according to their shapes. Long bones, such as the femur, are longer than they are wide. Short bones, such as the carpals, are approximately equal in length, width, and thickness. Flat bones are thin, but are often curved, such as the ribs. Irregular bones such as those of the face have no characteristic shape. Sesamoid bones, such as the patellae, are small and round, and are located in tendons.  
骨骼可以根据其形状进行分类。长骨，如股骨，长于宽。短骨，如腕骨，在长度、宽度和厚度上大致相等。扁平骨很薄，但通常是弯曲的，例如肋骨。不规则的骨骼，如面部的骨骼，没有特征性的形状。芝麻骨（籽骨），如髌骨，小而圆，位于肌腱中。

A hollow medullary cavity filled with yellow marrow runs the length of the diaphysis of a long bone. The walls of the diaphysis are compact bone. The epiphyses, which are wider sections at each end of a long bone, are filled with spongy bone and red marrow. The epiphyseal plate, a layer of hyaline cartilage, is replaced by osseous tissue as the organ grows in length. The medullary cavity has a delicate membranous lining called the endosteum. The outer surface of bone, except in regions covered with articular cartilage, is covered with a fibrous membrane called the periosteum. Flat bones consist of two layers of compact bone surrounding a layer of spongy bone. Bone markings depend on the function and location of bones. Articulations are places where two bones meet. Projections stick out from the surface of the bone and provide attachment points for tendons and ligaments. Holes are openings or depressions in the bones.  
一个充满黄骨髓的中空髓腔与长骨的骨干长度相同。骨干壁是密质骨。骨骺是长骨两端较宽的部分，充满了松质骨和红骨髓。骨骺板是一层透明软骨，随着器官长度的增加，骨组织被骨组织取代。髓腔有一层精致的膜层，称为骨内膜。骨骼的外表面，除了被关节软骨覆盖的区域外，都覆盖着称为骨膜的纤维膜。扁平骨由两层致密的骨骼组成，~~周围环绕着~~（中间夹着）一层海绵状骨。骨骼标记取决于骨骼的功能和位置。关节是两块骨头相遇的地方。突起从骨骼表面伸出，为肌腱和韧带提供附着点。孔洞是骨骼上的开口或凹陷。

Bone matrix consists of collagen fibers and organic ground substance, primarily hydroxyapatite formed from calcium salts. Osteogenic cells develop into osteoblasts. Osteoblasts are cells that make new bone. They become osteocytes, the cells of mature bone, when they get trapped in the matrix. Osteoclasts engage in bone resorption. Compact bone is dense and composed of osteons, while spongy bone is less dense and made up of trabeculae. Blood vessels and nerves enter the bone through the nutrient foramina to nourish and innervate bones.  
骨基质由胶原纤维和有机研磨物质组成，主要是由钙盐形成的羟基磷灰石。[[6.3.骨骼结构#^4e53de|骨原细胞]]发育成成骨细胞。成骨细胞是制造新骨骼的细胞。当它们被困在基质中时，它们就会变成骨细胞，即成熟骨骼的细胞。破骨细胞参与骨吸收。密质骨密度大，由骨单位组成，而松质骨的密度较低，由小梁组成。血管和神经通过营养孔进入骨骼，滋养和支配骨骼。

# [[6.4.骨骼形成和发育|4. Bone Formation and Development 骨骼形成和发育]]

All bone formation is a replacement process. Embryos develop a cartilaginous skeleton and various membranes. During development, these are replaced by bone during the ossification process. In intramembranous ossification, bone develops directly from sheets of mesenchymal connective tissue. In endochondral ossification, bone develops by replacing hyaline cartilage. Activity in the epiphyseal plate enables bones to grow in length. Modeling allows bones to grow in diameter. Remodeling occurs as bone is resorbed and replaced by new bone. Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disease in which collagen production is altered, resulting in fragile, brittle bones.  

所有的骨形成都是一个替代过程。胚胎发育出软骨骨骼和各种膜。在发育过程中，这些东西在骨化过程中被骨取代。在膜内骨化中，骨直接从间充质结缔组织片发育而来。在软骨内骨化中，骨骼通过替换透明软骨而发育。<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">骨骺板的活动使骨骼长度增加</mark>。塑建允许骨骼的直径增长。当骨被重新吸收并被新骨替换时，就会发生重塑。成骨不全症是一种遗传性疾病，其中胶原蛋白的产生被改变，导致骨骼脆弱、易碎。 ^f81967

# [[6.5.骨折：骨修复|5. Fractures: Bone Repair 骨折：骨修复]]

Fractured bones may be repaired by closed reduction or open reduction. Fractures are classified by their complexity, location, and other features. Common types of fractures are transverse, oblique, spiral, comminuted, impacted, greenstick, open (or compound), and closed (or simple). Healing of fractures begins with the formation of a hematoma, followed by internal and external calli. Osteoclasts resorb dead bone, while osteoblasts create new bone that replaces the cartilage in the calli. The calli eventually unite, remodeling occurs, and healing is complete.  
骨折可以通过闭合复位或开放复位来修复。骨折根据其复杂性、位置和其他特征进行分类。常见的骨折类型有横向骨折、斜型骨折、螺旋骨折、粉碎骨折、嵌插骨折、青枝骨折、开放性骨折（或复合骨折）和闭合性骨折（或单纯性骨折）。骨折的愈合始于血肿的形成，然后是内愈伤组织和外愈伤组织。破骨细胞吸收死骨，而成骨细胞则产生新的骨骼来取代愈伤组织中的软骨。愈伤组织最终结合在一起，发生重塑，愈合完成。

# [[6.6.运动、营养、激素和骨组织|6. Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones, and Bone Tissue 运动、营养、激素和骨组织]]

Mechanical stress stimulates the deposition of mineral salts and collagen fibers within bones. Calcium, the predominant mineral in bone, cannot be absorbed from the small intestine if vitamin D is lacking. Vitamin K supports bone mineralization and may have a synergistic role with vitamin D. Magnesium and fluoride, as structural elements, play a supporting role in bone health. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation and may promote production of new osseous tissue. Growth hormone increases the length of long bones, enhances mineralization, and improves bone density. Thyroxine stimulates bone growth and promotes the synthesis of bone matrix. The sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone) promote osteoblastic activity and the production of bone matrix, are responsible for the adolescent growth spurt, and promote closure of the epiphyseal plates. Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by decreased bone mass that is common in aging adults. Calcitriol stimulates the digestive tract to absorb calcium and phosphate. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates osteoclast proliferation and resorption of bone by osteoclasts. Vitamin D plays a synergistic role with PTH in stimulating the osteoclasts. Additional functions of PTH include promoting reabsorption of calcium by kidney tubules and indirectly increasing calcium absorption from the small intestine. Calcitonin inhibits osteoclast activity and stimulates calcium uptake by bones.  
机械应力刺激矿物盐和胶原纤维在骨骼内的沉积。钙是骨骼中的主要矿物质，但如果缺乏维生素D，钙就不能从小肠吸收。维生素K支持骨矿化，并可能与维生素D具有协同作用。镁和氟化物作为结构元素，在骨骼健康中起着支持作用。Omega-3脂肪酸可减少炎症，并可能促进新骨组织的产生。生长激素可增加长骨的长度（[[6.9.章节快速回顾#^f81967|骨骺板的活动也可以增加骨骼长度]]），增强矿化，提高骨密度。甲状腺素刺激骨骼生长，促进骨基质的合成。性激素（雌激素和睾酮）促进成骨细胞活性和骨基质的产生，负责青少年生长突增，并促进骨骺板的闭合。骨质疏松症是一种以骨量减少为特征的疾病，在老年人中很常见。骨化三醇刺激消化道吸收钙和磷酸盐。甲状旁腺激素 （PTH） 刺激破骨细胞增殖和破骨细胞对骨的吸收。维生素D与PTH在刺激破骨细胞方面起着协同作用。PTH的其他功能包括促进肾小管对钙的重吸收，并间接增加小肠对钙的吸收。降钙素抑制破骨细胞活性并刺激骨骼对钙的吸收。

# [[6.7.钙稳态：骨骼系统和其他器官系统的相互作用|7. Calcium Homeostasis: Interactions of the Skeletal System and Other Organ Systems 钙稳态：骨骼系统与其他器官系统的相互作用]]

Calcium homeostasis, i.e., maintaining a blood calcium level of about 10 mg/dL, is critical for normal body functions. Hypocalcemia can result in problems with blood coagulation, muscle contraction, nerve functioning, and bone strength. Hypercalcemia can result in lethargy, sluggish reflexes, constipation and loss of appetite, confusion, and coma. Calcium homeostasis is controlled by PTH, vitamin D, and calcitonin and the interactions of the skeletal, endocrine, digestive, and urinary systems.  
钙稳态，即维持约 10 mg/dL 的血钙水平，对正常的身体功能至关重要。低钙血症可导致血液凝固、肌肉收缩、神经功能和骨强度问题。高钙血症可导致嗜睡、反应迟钝、便秘和食欲不振、意识模糊和昏迷。钙稳态受 PTH、维生素 D 和降钙素以及骨骼、内分泌、消化和泌尿系统的相互作用控制。
