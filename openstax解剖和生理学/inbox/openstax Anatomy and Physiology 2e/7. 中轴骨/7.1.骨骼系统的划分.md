# 概述

The skeletal system includes all of the bones, cartilages, and ligaments of the body that support and give shape to the body and body structures. The skeleton consists of the bones of the body. For adults, there are 206 bones in the skeleton. Younger individuals have higher numbers of bones because some bones fuse together during childhood and adolescence to form an adult bone. The primary functions of the skeleton are to provide a rigid, internal structure that can support the weight of the body against the force of gravity, and to provide a structure upon which muscles can act to produce movements of the body. The lower portion of the skeleton is specialized for stability during walking or running. In contrast, the upper skeleton has greater mobility and ranges of motion, features that allow you to lift and carry objects or turn your head and trunk.  

骨骼系统包括身体的所有骨骼、软骨和韧带，它们支撑身体、塑造身体和身体结构。骨架由身体的骨骼组成。对于成人来说，骨架中有206块骨头。年轻人的骨骼数量更多，因为一些骨头在儿童期和青春期期间会融合在一起，形成成人的骨头。骨架的主要功能是提供一个坚固的内部结构，可以支撑身体的重量来抵抗重力，以及提供一个结构使肌肉可以作用于上面，产生身体的运动。骨架的下部专门用于在行走或跑步时保持稳定性。相比之下，上部骨架具有更大的活动性和运动范围，这些功能允许你举起和搬运物体或转动头部和躯干。

In addition to providing for support and movements of the body, the skeleton has protective and storage functions. It protects the internal organs, including the brain, spinal cord, heart, lungs, and pelvic organs. The bones of the skeleton serve as the primary storage site for important minerals such as calcium and phosphate. The bone marrow found within bones stores fat and houses the blood-cell producing tissue of the body.  

除了提供身体的支撑和运动外，骨架还具有保护和存储功能。它保护内部器官，包括大脑、脊髓、心脏、肺和盆腔器官。骨架的骨骼是重要矿物质如钙和磷的主要储存地。骨髓存在于骨头内部，储存脂肪并容纳身体的血细胞产生组织。

The skeleton is subdivided into two major divisions—the axial and appendicular.  

骨架被划分为两个主要部分——轴向骨架（中轴骨）和附肢骨架。

# The Axial Skeleton 轴向骨架

The skeleton is subdivided into two major divisions—the axial and appendicular. The axial skeleton forms the vertical, central axis of the body and includes all bones of the head, neck, chest, and back ([Figure 7.2](https://openstax.org/books/anatomy-and-physiology-2e/pages/7-1-divisions-of-the-skeletal-system#fig-ch07_01_01)). It serves to protect the brain, spinal cord, heart, and lungs. It also serves as the attachment site for muscles that move the head, neck, and back, and for muscles that act across the shoulder and hip joints to move their corresponding limbs.  

骨骼细分为两个主要部分——轴向和附肢。轴向骨骼形成身体的垂直中轴，包括头部、颈部、胸部和背部的所有骨骼（图 7.2）。它用于保护大脑、脊髓、心脏和肺。它也是移动头部、颈部和背部的肌肉，以及作用于肩关节和髋关节移动相应肢体的肌肉的附着点

The axial skeleton of the adult consists of 80 bones, including the skull, the vertebral column, and the thoracic cage. The skull is formed by 22 bones. Also associated with the head are an additional seven bones, including the hyoid bone and the ear ossicles (three small bones found in each middle ear). The vertebral column consists of 24 bones, each called a vertebra, plus the sacrum and coccyx. The thoracic cage includes the 12 pairs of ribs, and the sternum, the flattened bone of the anterior chest.  

成人的轴向骨架由80块骨头组成，包括颅骨、脊柱和胸廓。颅骨由22块骨头构成。与头部相关的还有额外的七块骨头，包括舌骨和耳小骨（每个中耳中有三个小骨）。脊柱由24块称为椎骨的骨头组成，加上骶骨和尾骨。胸廓包括12对肋骨和胸骨，胸骨是前胸的扁平骨。![[Pasted image 20240324102556.png]]*（这个图就不翻了吧兄弟，看图识字认认骨头啊这就是，主要看看右下角那个key就行）*
Figure 7.2 Axial and Appendicular Skeleton The axial skeleton supports the head, neck, back, and chest and thus forms the vertical axis of the body. It consists of the skull, vertebral column (including the sacrum and coccyx), and the thoracic cage, formed by the ribs and sternum. The appendicular skeleton is made up of all bones of the upper and lower limbs.  

图 7.2 轴向骨架和附肢骨架 轴向骨架支撑头部、颈部、背部和胸部，从而形成身体的垂直轴。它由颅骨、脊柱（包括骶骨和尾骨）和由肋骨及胸骨构成的胸廓组成。附肢骨架由上肢和下肢的所有骨骼组成。
# The Appendicular Skeleton   附肢骨架

The appendicular skeleton includes all bones of the upper and lower limbs, plus the bones that attach each limb to the axial skeleton. There are 126 bones in the appendicular skeleton of an adult. The bones of the appendicular skeleton are covered in a separate chapter.  

附肢骨架包括上肢和下肢的所有骨骼，以及将每个肢体连接到轴向骨架的骨头。成人的附肢骨架有126块骨头。附肢骨架的骨骼在另一章节中有所介绍。
