The skeletal system forms the rigid internal framework of the body. It consists of the bones, cartilages, and ligaments. Bones support the weight of the body, allow for body movements, and protect internal organs. Cartilage provides flexible strength and support for body structures such as the thoracic cage, the external ear, and the trachea and larynx. At joints of the body, cartilage can also unite adjacent bones or provide cushioning between them. Ligaments are the strong connective tissue bands that hold the bones at a moveable joint together and serve to prevent excessive movements of the joint that would result in injury. Providing movement of the skeleton are the muscles of the body, which are firmly attached to the skeleton via connective tissue structures called tendons. As muscles contract, they pull on the bones to produce movements of the body. Thus, without a skeleton, you would not be able to stand, run, or even feed yourself!

骨骼系统构成了身体的坚硬内部框架。它由骨骼、软骨和韧带组成。骨骼支撑身体的重量，允许身体运动，并保护内脏器官。软骨为身体结构提供灵活的力量和支撑，如胸廓、外耳以及气管和喉。在身体的关节处，软骨也可以联合相邻的骨头或在它们之间提供缓冲。韧带是强大的结缔组织带，它们将活动关节的骨头固定在一起，并防止关节的过度移动导致伤害。~~提供骨骼运动的是身体的肌肉~~（身体的肌肉使骨骼可以运动），它们通过称为肌腱的结缔组织结构牢固地附着在骨骼上。当肌肉收缩时，它们会拉动骨骼以产生身体的运动。因此，没有骨骼，你将无法站立、跑步，甚至无法自己进食！

Each bone of the body serves a particular function, and therefore bones vary in size, shape, and strength based on these functions. For example, the bones of the lower back and lower limb are thick and strong to support your body weight. Similarly, the size of a bony landmark that serves as a muscle attachment site on an individual bone is related to the strength of this muscle. Muscles can apply very strong pulling forces to the bones of the skeleton. To resist these forces, bones have enlarged bony landmarks at sites where powerful muscles attach. This means that not only the size of a bone, but also its shape, is related to its function. For this reason, the identification of bony landmarks is important during your study of the skeletal system.

身体的每一块骨骼都有其特定的功能，因此基于这些功能，骨骼在大小、形状和强度上各不相同。例如，下背部和下肢的骨骼又厚又结实，可以支撑你的体重。同样，个别骨骼上作为肌肉附着点的骨性标志的大小与这一肌肉的强度有关。肌肉可以对骨骼施加非常强大的拉力。为了抵抗这些力量，骨头在强大肌肉附着的地方扩大了骨性标志。这意味着，不只骨头的大小，骨头的形状也与功能有关。因此，在学习骨骼系统时，识别骨性标志很重要。

Bones are also dynamic organs that can modify their strength and thickness in response to changes in muscle strength or body weight. Thus, muscle attachment sites on bones will thicken if you begin a workout program that increases muscle strength. Similarly, the walls of weight-bearing bones will thicken if you gain body weight or begin <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pounding the pavement</mark> as part of a new running regimen. In contrast, a reduction in muscle strength or body weight will cause bones to become thinner. This may happen during a prolonged hospital stay, following limb immobilization in a cast, or going into the weightlessness of outer space. Even a change in diet, such as eating only soft food due to the loss of teeth, will result in a noticeable decrease in the size and thickness of the jaw bones.  

骨骼也是动态的器官，可以根据肌肉力量或体重的变化调整其强度和厚度。因此，如果你开始增加肌肉力量的锻炼计划，骨头上的肌肉附着点会变厚。同样，如果你增加体重或开始进行新的跑步训练（<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">猛击人行道</mark>，这个形容真的搞），重量承载骨的壁会变厚。相反，肌肉力量或体重的减少会导致骨头变薄。这可能发生在长期住院、四肢在石膏中固定后或进入外太空的失重状态期间。甚至饮食的改变，比如因失去牙齿只吃软食物，也会导致下颚骨的大小和厚度明显减少。
